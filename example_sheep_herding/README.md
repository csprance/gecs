# Sheep Herding

A small ECS demo showing reactive observers, relationship-driven flocking, a
CommandBuffer-safe flee/wander state machine, and CharacterBody3D +
NavigationAgent3D movement — all wired on top of GECS.

The shepherd's sheep escaped. Drive the shepherd with WASD (hold Shift to
sprint) and herd every sheep back into the pen.

## Controls

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| W/A/S/D | Move shepherd (camera-relative) |
| Shift | Sprint |

## Entities

### Sheep (`entities/e_sheep.tscn`)
`CharacterBody3D` carrying:
- `C_Sheep` — zero-field species tag used in every sheep query.
- `C_SheepMovement` — walk / run / rotation speed.
- `C_SheepThreat` — flee / safe radii (hysteresis: `safe_radius > flee_radius`).
- `C_Flocking` — separation / alignment / cohesion weights.
- `C_Wander` — random-target state (where to go next, rest timer).
- `C_Velocity` — the shared velocity bus read by the velocity-integration system.

The scene also carries a `NavigationAgent3D` for pathfinding and a `FlockArea3D`
(Area3D trigger) that records flockmate relationships on overlap.

### Shepherd (`entities/e_shepherd.tscn`)
`CharacterBody3D` carrying:
- `C_Shepherd` — move speed, sprint multiplier, rotation speed.
- `C_Velocity` — the shepherd's velocity, written by `ShepherdSystem`.

### Pen (`entities/e_pen.tscn`)
`Node3D` carrying `C_Pen` (radius). Holds a `PenArea3D` (Area3D) child whose
`body_entered` signal emits the `&"sheep_entered_pen"` ECS event.

## Systems (`systems/`, group `sim`, runs in `_physics_process`)

Order matters — steering writes to `C_Velocity`, integration reads it:

1. **ShepherdSystem** — reads WASD, writes camera-relative velocity + rotation,
   follows the main camera.
2. **WanderSystem** — picks random targets, drives each sheep's
   NavigationAgent3D toward them, blends flocking into the path direction,
   writes velocity. Uses `sub_systems()` to split free vs. penned wanderers
   into two queries (`with_none([C_Penned])` vs. `with_all([C_Penned])`)
   that share one loop with an `is_penned` flag — free sheep escalate to
   `C_Flee` when the shepherd enters their flee radius and pick goals around
   themselves; penned sheep ignore the shepherd and pick goals inside the pen.
3. **FleeSystem** — writes a direct-away velocity at run speed. Strips
   `C_Flee` (via CommandBuffer) when the shepherd leaves the safe radius.
4. **SheepVelocitySystem** — reads `C_Velocity` on every entity, calls
   `CharacterBody3D.move_and_slide` (or falls back to direct position
   integration for non-CharacterBody3D entities).

## Observers (`observers/`)

Reactive — they don't run every frame, only fire on specific events.

- **O_SheepEnteredPen** — subscribes to the custom
  `&"sheep_entered_pen"` event emitted by `PenArea3D.body_entered`. Tags the
  sheep with `C_Penned`, copying the pen's center + radius onto the component,
  and clears any active `C_Flee`. `C_Penned` doesn't spawn a new system: it
  just flips two things in the existing wander/flee loop —
  `WanderSystem` samples new goals inside the pen instead of around the sheep,
  and `FleeSystem` (which uses `with_none([C_Penned])`) skips them entirely so
  the shepherd can't scare them out.

## Flocking via Relationships

Each sheep carries a `FlockArea3D` (Area3D trigger). When two sheep overlap,
`FlockArea._on_area_entered` creates a `C_Flockmate` relationship pointing from
self to the other. `Flocking.compute` (in `lib/flocking.gd`) then reads those
relationships via `entity.get_relationships(R_AnyFlockmate)` — no per-frame
O(N²) distance scan. `R_AnyFlockmate` is a module-static relationship pattern
(a wildcard `Relationship(C_Flockmate.new(), null)`) reused across all calls
to avoid per-call allocation.

## Notes for Readers

- **Pathfinding:** the `NavigationRegion3D` in `main.tscn` needs to be baked in
  the editor (select the node → click "Bake NavigationMesh"). Without a baked
  mesh, NavigationAgent3D degrades gracefully to direct-line movement.
- **Frame timing:** only `_physics_process` drives the `sim` group — every
  system uses `delta` consistently at 60Hz regardless of display refresh rate.
- **One-way penning:** once a sheep has `C_Penned`, it never leaves that state.
  The win condition is all sheep penned.
